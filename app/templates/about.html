    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://conp.ca">
      Canadian Open Neuroscience Platform (CONP)
    </a>
    Portal is a web interface that facilitates open science for the neuroscience community
    by simplifying global access and sharing of datasets and tools. The Portal internalizes
    the typical data cycle of a research project, beginning with data acquisition, followed
    by data processing with published tools, and ultimately publication of the results with
    a link to the original dataset.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CONP Portal was built using technologies and best practices that make
    sharing easier and reproducible. Datasets are tracked and indexed using
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.datalad.org">
      DataLad,

      Git-Annex and,

  <h2>What kinds of data can I find on the CONP Portal?</h2>
  <p>
    The CONP Portal provides a gateway to a diverse range of approximately {{ countDatasets }}
    datasets including neuroimaging, histology, electrophysiology, transcriptomics, genomics,
    and many other data modalities. Many of these datasets have been provided by neuroscience
    research institutes across Canada, while others link to publicly available
    resources that may be of interest to neuroscientists. A full list can be found
    <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/search">
      here.
    </a>
  </p>
  <img class="img-fluid" style="width:50%;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto"
       alt="Dataset Graph" src="/static/img/CONP-datasets.png" />
  <p>
    Among them, for instance, is the Pre-symptomatic Evaluation of Experimental or Novel
    Treatments for Alzheimer Disease (PREVENT-AD)
    <a
      target="_blank",
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      href="/search?sortKey=conpStatus&sortComparitor=asc&page=1&max_per_page=10&cursor=0&limit=10&search=PREVENT-AD"
    >
      datasets.
    </a>
    Those datasets include longitudinal MRI scans and basic demographics on over 300 individuals
    with a family history of Alzheimer's Disease. In addition, more sensitive data are also
    available to Principal Investigators through a registered-access database of the PREVENT-AD
    dataset. These registered-access data include clinical, cognitive, CSF protein levels and
    other biomarkers measures.
  </p>


  <h2>How can I access datasets</h2>
  <p>
    The CONP Portal allows you to access and process data on public and private
    infrastructures. Data stored in private projects can be accessed by
    registered users and portal administrators. The ownership of all data uploaded and
    stored on the CONP Portal is retained by the original owner, along with all
    copyright and license attributes.
  </p>
  <p>
    The CONP Portal was designed to parse existing datasets from both external and
    internal sources, allowing it to source a very wide variety of datasets. To access
    data, the user will first go to the
    <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/search">
      Data Search page
    </a>
    and filter for data of interest. Clicking on an individual dataset will provide
    more detailed information and download instructions. Depending on the dataset, data
    download may be available through both the
    <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.datalad.org">
      DataLad
    </a>
    data management system and a one-click direct download function.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once a dataset has been chosen, we also provide a wide range of
    <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/pipelines">
      tools and pipelines
    </a>
    with which to process them. Read the following sections to find out more.
  </p>


  <h2>What tool/pipelines are accessible via the CONP Portal?</h2>
  <p>
    The CONP Portal aggregates a diverse range of {{ countPipelines }} tools and
    pipelines. Many of these are well-established and have been provided by
    neuroscience or genomics research institutes. A full list can be found
    <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="/pipelines">
      here.
    </a>
  </p>


  <h2>How can I use tools/pipelines?</h2>
  <p>
    Several mechanisms are available to run tools and pipelines found on the CONP Portal:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      locally on any system using
      <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://boutiques.github.io/">
        Boutiques
      </a>
      and a container engine (
      <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://www.docker.com">
        Docker
      </a>
      or
      <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://sylabs.io/docs/">
        Singularity
      </a>
      ) based on the
      <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://zenodo.org/">
        Zenodo
      </a>
      ID of the tool. ( If you have never used Boutiques in the past, we recommend the
      following

      </a>
      )
    </li>
    <li>
      on High Perfomance Computing (HPC) infrastructure via

        CBRAIN
      </a>
    </li>
  </ul>


  <h2>How can I share/upload a dataset?</h2>
  <p>
    The CONP Portal offers a distributed, automated, and simple manner for sharing data
    according to the
    <a target="_blank", rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/">
      FAIR principles
    </a>
    , which includes interoperability. This allows the Portal to share data either through API connections
    to existing platforms or by providing resources to users who lack storage/sharing infrastructure.
  </p>
  <p>
    Data can be uploaded to the CONP Portal via the following mechanisms (
